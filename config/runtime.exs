import Config

# config/runtime.exs is executed for all environments, including
# during releases. It is executed after compilation and before the
# system starts, so it is typically used to load production configuration
# and secrets from environment variables or elsewhere. Do not define
# any compile-time configuration in here, as it won't be applied.
# The block below contains prod specific runtime configuration.

# ## Using releases
#
# If you use `mix release`, you need to explicitly enable the server
# by passing the PHX_SERVER=true when you start it:
#
#     PHX_SERVER=true bin/portfolio start
#
# Alternatively, you can use `mix phx.gen.release` to generate a `bin/server`
# script that automatically sets the env var above.
if System.get_env("PHX_SERVER") do
  config :portfolio, PortfolioWeb.Endpoint, server: true
end

if config_env() == :prod do
  secret_key_base =
    System.get_env("SECRET_KEY_BASE") ||
      raise """
      environment variable SECRET_KEY_BASE is missing.
      You can generate one by calling: mix phx.gen.secret
      """

  host = System.get_env("PHX_HOST")
  port = String.to_integer(System.get_env("PORT"))

  config :portfolio, :dns_cluster_query, System.get_env("DNS_CLUSTER_QUERY")

  config :portfolio, PortfolioWeb.Endpoint,
    url: [host: host, port: 443, scheme: "https"],
    http: [
      # Enable IPv6 and bind on all interfaces.
      # Set it to  {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1} for local network only access.
      # See the documentation on https://hexdocs.pm/bandit/Bandit.html#t:options/0
      # for details about using IPv6 vs IPv4 and loopback vs public addresses.
      ip: {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},

  # ## SSL Support
  #
  # To get SSL working, you will need to add the `https` key
  # to your endpoint configuration:
  #
  #     config :portfolio, PortfolioWeb.Endpoint,
  #       https: [
  #         ...,
  #         port: 443,
  #         cipher_suite: :strong,
  #         keyfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_KEY_PATH"),
  #         certfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_CERT_PATH")
  #       ]
  #
  # The `cipher_suite` is set to `:strong` to support only the
  # latest and more secure SSL ciphers. This means old browsers
  # and clients may not be supported. You can set it to
  # `:compatible` for wider support.
  #
  # `:keyfile` and `:certfile` expect an absolute path to the key
  # and cert in disk or a relative path inside priv, for example
  # "priv/ssl/server.key". For all supported SSL configuration
  # options, see https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.SSL.html#configure/1
  #
  # We also recommend setting `force_ssl` in your config/prod.exs,
  # ensuring no data is ever sent via http, always redirecting to https:
  #
  #     config :portfolio, PortfolioWeb.Endpoint,
  #       force_ssl: [hsts: true]
  #
  # Check `Plug.SSL` for all available options in `force_ssl`.

  # ## Configuring the mailer
  #
  # In production you need to configure the mailer to use a different adapter.
  # Also, you may need to configure the Swoosh API client of your choice if you
  # are not using SMTP. Here is an example of the configuration:
  #

  config :portfolio, Portfolio.Mailer,
    adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Sendgrid,
    name: System.get_env("CONTACT_NAME"),
    email: System.get_env("CONTACT_EMAIL"),
    server:
      System.get_env("SENDGRID_SERVER") ||
        raise("""
        environment variable SENDGRID_SERVER is missing.
        You can find it in your SendGrid account.
        """),
    username:
      System.get_env("SENDGRID_USERNAME") ||
        raise("""
        environment variable SENDGRID_USERNAME is missing.
        You can find it in your SendGrid account.
        """),
    api_key:
      System.get_env("SENDGRID_API_KEY") ||
        raise("""
        environment variable SENDGRID_API_KEY is missing.
        You can generate from your SendGrid account.
        """)

  #
  # For this example you need include a HTTP client required by Swoosh API client.
  # Swoosh supports Hackney and Finch out of the box:
  #
  #     config :swoosh, :api_client, Swoosh.ApiClient.Hackney
  #
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/swoosh/Swoosh.html#module-installation for details.
