Since I've started programming three years ago, I've had plenty of times where
documentation just wasn't enough and that I needed someone who wrote a small
(or not) tutorial on my topic.

It could be a niche one or something more general, but there was often someone
who shared their experience. And when there wasn't, it was a bit frustrating.

That's why I started this blog. To hopefully help someone (or myself in the
future) about a topic they're struggling with.

I'll post how-to's, tutorials on how to implement certain things or full-blown
series about a project implemented step-by-step. I'll also post about new
experiences and opinions around certain topics.

I hope to see you around for my next posts, in which I'll try to improve my
writing skills and help you with something.

See you soon ðŸ‘‹
